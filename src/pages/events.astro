              Our Project Nights are an opportunity for our members to learn about AI 
              and get hands on experience building. We provide topics for our 
              members to learn about and work on, from beginner, to intermediate, 
              and then to advanced difficulty.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="section-content">
              Members will work on these topics in pairs, ideally with one IT and one 
              non-IT student. This way, IT students can reinforce their knowledge while 
              non-IT students get the support they need. This makes it rewarding for 
              both. Each topic is run like a mini course: we explain the concept, give 
              its background and practical uses, and share an annotated example 
              solution. Members then complete three challenge projects to build the 
              ML model themselves.

              learning and real-world applications, giving students firsthand exposure 
              to industry trends, career pathways, and practical advice for navigating
